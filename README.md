# Dynamic programing
This maze solver recursively calculates how many moves it takes to get to that specific spot. It dose this by adding the value above the current spot with the value to the left and saving that value in a grid. It also accunts for obstacles in its path which calculate to 0.

To see the results type *python, py,* or *python3 dynamic-programing.py* 

You will be able to see all of the tests I ran for the project. If you want to change any tests you will have to download the code.

# Brute force
This maze solver recursively calculates how many moves it takes to get to that specific spot. It dose this by adding the value above the current spot with the value to the left. This one doesn't save the values in a grid for later use but it still accounts for obstacles. 

To see the results type *python, py,* or *python3 brute-force.py*

This shows the tests I ran for the project and if you want to cahnge any of the inputs you will have to download the code.
